COUNT THINGS AND RECORD LOCATION IN TEXT
Jeff Thompson | 2014 | www.jeffreythompson.org

A more applied example - count the occurrences of things
like names in the text, but also keep track of their overall
location. This allows us to see a 'histogram' of where
characters or ideas occur and where they do not.

CHALLENGE:
1. What kinds of words would be interesting to count? Can you create
   a robust regular expression to catch all variations (capitalized, etc)?
2. Can you compare the count of two or more terms? How might you visualize the results?

frodo = []													# create a blank list, add items per line
totalCount = 0												# count of instances of the word (set to 0 for now)

# first, we merge the text into one big long string, then split that
# into roughly page-length chunks - this gives us better stats on the
# flow of the book

for start in range(0, len(fullText), pageSize):		# run through text from pos 0 - end in pageSize steps!
	pages.append(fullText[start:start+pageSize])	# add an entry to the list of the specified size

# open file and read page-by-page

	totalCount += len(instancesOfWord)				# add the length of the list (# of words matched) to our overall count
	frodo.append(len(instancesOfWord))				# add a new record in the list - each line from the file will have a different value

# get some stats from our results
