PythonTeachingExamples
======================

Example scripts for learning Python. Currently examples are for text parsing for data visualization.

**GETTING STARTED**  
We'll be writing code in a text editor - I recommend one of the following:  
+	Text Wrangler (free, [download here](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html))  
+	Sublime Text (free with paid upgrade, [download here](http://www.sublimetext.com/2))

Python is a scripting language that is very powerful, but easy to get started with. It should come pre-installed on your computer! To check, open your command line:  
+	Mac users: Applications > Utilities > Terminal  
+	PC users: Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt

To see if Python is set up, type `python` into the window - you should get a bunch of information on which version you have set up.

**WRITING YOUR FIRST SCRIPT**  
All Python scripts (programs) will be written in your text editor and saved with the `.py` extension. See the `Basics` folder for some simple examples.

Once written, you can run your script using the following:  
+	Text Wrangler: #! > Run in Terminal...  
+	Sublime Text: Tools > Build... (or command/control B)

Your script should run, either in the Terminal window (Text Wrangler) or in the built-in console (Sublime Text).

**BASICS**  
Just a few simple scripts to get you started. Covers printing, data types, and basic math operators.

**TEXT PARSING**  
Basic to intermediate examples on manipulating text.

**UTILITIES**  
Random assortment of (hopefully) useful scripts.
