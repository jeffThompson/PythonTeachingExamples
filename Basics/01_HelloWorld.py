HELLO WORLD
Jeff Thompson | 2014 | www.jeffreythompson.org

Our first Python sketch!

This text is a comment - a piece of code that doesn't
do anything, but let's us leave notes to ourselves
or others. It is contained between three single-quotes.

At the top of any script, always include at least
a descriptive title, your name, and a way of getting
in touch with you (email or web address). I like to
include a year as well.

Try running the script. If everything works, change
the output text or add multiple 'print' commands.

# this is a single-line comment, starting with the hash-mark
# use this in your code for shorter notes

# print the worlds "Hello, world!" onscreen
print 'Hello, world!'		# comments can be here, too!
